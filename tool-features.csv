Documentation ,Goal,,Allow web application testing to be automated with scripts written in XML or Groovy,"Create a safety net for refactoring by separating the test intention (written in plain English) from the test implementation (written in Java), so the latter can change, as the system's design evolves, while the former catches regression bugs.Most other testing frameworks mix together the test intention with its implementation.",Write business scenarios in structured English.,Write user stories and acceptance criteria (scenarios) in plain-text files in any language.,"Detailed requirements in terms of business rules, objects and processes, test automation, table-based DSL",Web based version of Fit.,Smaller version of Fitness.,"Use Automated Functional Testing as an ""Executable Specification"" mechanism that optimize requirement communication between customers/users/field experts and the developers team.  All this in order to build the right software, the one needed.","Functional acceptance testing (black-box) throughthe GUI to test programs as the end user will see them.Removal of programming effort from acceptance testing.Use in agile processes (tests created in parallel with development).","TestWise IDE is a Next-Generation Functional Testing tool to help developers, testers to write maintainable automated tests effectively (Formerly known as iTest2).TestWise is built from ground up to support team collaboration in automated testing with  refactoring test elements, command completion, incremental syntax validation (based on the domain specific test language), keyboard navigation into the supporting framework code, and much more...",Gui Automation with Python,Robot Framework is a generic keyword-driven test automation framework for acceptance level testing and acceptance test-driven development (ATDD),Provide a Java interface to Sahi,Selenium tests web apps on any OS in any browser with any language., Simple Web Automation Toolkit: Build on Fitnesse to improve it,Functional test of Swing and JavaFX UIs. Intended users: developers and testers,Requirements Traceability & Project Progress Monitoring,Twist is a collaboration platform in which business users can express testing intent (similar to requirements) in simple english and technical users can render these english statements executable using the inbuilt power of the IDE and supported variety of languages. Through this Twist promotes the notion of software specifications also becoming executable tests. Twist supports multiple industry standard drivers that can be used to implement test intent., Web Application Testing In .Net: Automate tests with Internet Explorer and FireFox using .Net,Web Application Testing in Ruby: Automated testing that doesn't hurt,"Automate all windows applications except browser, if they support UIAutomation.Provide the driver to test and let the programming language of choice do the rest."
